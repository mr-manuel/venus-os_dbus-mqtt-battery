## Disclaimer

I wrote this script for myself. I'm not responsible, if you damage something using my script.

## Purpose

The script emulates a battery in Venus OS. It gets the MQTT data from a subscribed topic and publishes the information on the dbus as the service `com.victronenergy.battery.mqtt_battery` with the VRM instance `41`.

It also can be used to aggregate multiple batteries. In this case you can use Node-RED to read the data from multiple batteries and then feed the calculated data to this driver, which then is selected as battery monitor.


## Config

Copy or rename the `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini` in the `dbus-mqtt-battery` folder and change it as you need it.


## JSON structure

Please remove the `--> *` comments to get a valid `JSON`. Comments are not allowed in `JSON` structure, but for simplicity I added them.

### dbus-serialbattery

If you want to get the values from [`dbus-serialbattery`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery) without having to modify any data with Node-RED or other scripts, then with [`dbus-serialbattery`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery) version `v2.0.20241223dev` (or later) and `dbus-mqtt-battery` version `v1.0.10-dev (20241223)` (or later) this is easily possible.

To achieve this you need to:

1. Make sure to enable `PUBLISH_BATTERY_DATA_AS_JSON` in the `dbus-serialbattery` [`config.ini`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/f769aebeac3eb7a51b5f9c4e26ac3dd422d42eff/dbus-serialbattery/config.default.ini#L461-L463), since it's disabled by default. Restart `dbus-serialbattery` after you made the changes.

   Now all battery data for each battery is published to its own topic: `/N/<VRM_ID>/battery/<BATTERY_INSTANCE>/JsonData`. Replace `<VRM_ID>` with your VRM ID and  `<BATTERY_INSTANCE>` with the unique instance ID for that battery (one topic per battery).
2. In the `config.ini` of `dbus-mqtt-battery` set the Venus MQTT broker and the topic `/N/<VRM_ID>/battery/<BATTERY_INSTANCE>/JsonData` where the data is published.

Replace the placeholders `<...>` with your values.

This method will fetch automatically all available data for a specific battery from `dbus-serialbattery`. You cannot choose which data you need or not.

## Install / Update

1. Login to your Venus OS device via SSH. See [Venus OS:Root Access](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access#root_access) for more details.
2. Execute this commands to download and copy the files:

    ```bash

    wget -O /tmp/download_dbus-mqtt-battery.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-battery/master/download.sh

    bash /tmp/download_dbus-mqtt-battery.sh

    ```
3. Select the version you want to install.
4. Press enter for a single instance. For multiple instances, enter a number and press enter.

    Example:

   - Pressing enter or entering `1` will install the driver to `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery`.
   - Entering `2` will install the driver to `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery-2`.

### Extra steps for your first installation

5. Edit the config file to fit your needs. The correct command for your installation is shown after the installation.

   - If you pressed enter or entered `1` during installation:

    ```bash

    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery/config.ini

    ```

   - If you entered `2` during installation:

    ```bash

    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery-2/config.ini

    ```
6. Install the driver as a service. The correct command for your installation is shown after the installation.

   - If you pressed enter or entered `1` during installation:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery/install.sh

    ```

   - If you entered `2` during installation:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery-2/install.sh

    ```

    The daemon-tools should start this service automatically within seconds.

## Uninstall

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one. For example:

- To uninstall the default instance:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery/uninstall.sh

    ```
- To uninstall the second instance:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery-2/uninstall.sh

    ```

## Restart

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one. For example:

- To restart the default instance:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery/restart.sh

    ```
- To restart the second instance:

    ```bash

    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery-2/restart.sh

    ```

## Debugging

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one.

- To check the logs of the default instance:

    ```bash

    tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-battery/current | tai64nlocal

    ```
- To check the logs of the second instance:

    ```bash

    tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-battery-2/current | tai64nlocal

    ```

The service status can be checked with svstat `svstat /service/dbus-mqtt-battery`

This will output somethink like `/service/dbus-mqtt-battery: up (pid 5845) 185 seconds`

If the seconds are under 5 then the service crashes and gets restarted all the time. If you do not see anything in the logs you can increase the log level in `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-battery/dbus-mqtt-battery.py` by changing `level=logging.WARNING` to `level=logging.INFO` or `level=logging.DEBUG`

If the script stops with the message `dbus.exceptions.NameExistsException: Bus name already exists: com.victronenergy.battery.mqtt_battery"` it means that the service is still running or another service is using that bus name.

## Compatibility

This software supports the latest three stable versions of Venus OS. It may also work on older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
